How to run the application:

1.  install python 2.7.2
2.  install element tree package
3.  install id3
4.  launch main_interface.py

Note:  This was by and large a failed application.  We perhaps became too 
ambitious, and were unable to finish the project by the deadline (a little less than 
three months were given). The one major learning experience from this project was the 
use of the Agile/Scrum development cycle.
